# CloudCAD API — 2D drawings

Build a CloudCAD drawing as a JSON object (`cad_data`), send it with `cloudcad.model.create`, then
store it with `cloudcad.file.save`. This skill covers the `cad_data` schema and the
`cloudcad.model` / `cloudcad.file` namespaces.

> **Prerequisite:** auth, `options` and the `{ auth, options, functions }` envelope are in
> [`skyciv-api-v3`](../skyciv-api-v3/SKILL.md). **No `S3D.session.start` is needed.**
> `cloudcad.model.create` opens its own CloudCAD session (verified: without it, create returns
> *"CloudCAD session successfully created."* and a following `save` works). Adding
> `S3D.session.start` first does no harm but adds about 6 s.

**Units:** every coordinate and every length setting is **real-world millimetres**, whatever
`settings.canvasLengthUnits` says. That setting (`"mm"`, `"cm"`, `"m"`, `"ft"`, `"in"`) only
changes how dimension **labels** are displayed. Verified: a 7315.2 mm line with
`canvasLengthUnits: "ft"` is labelled `24.0 ft`.

## Workflow

1. **Draw at true size, in mm, with y negative going up** (see Coordinates). Never scale geometry
   to fit a page.
2. **Pick a plot scale and size the `attributeStyles` for it.** Every length-valued style setting
   is *printed mm × scale*, e.g. `dimensionTextSize: 378` at 1:100 prints at 3.78 mm (see Sizing).
3. **Wrap the drawing in the default page + title block**, unless the user asked for bare
   geometry. Translate the content into the template's safe zone; do not scale it. See
   [`references/pages-and-title-blocks.md`](references/pages-and-title-blocks.md).
4. **Lint, then send** `cloudcad.model.create` + `cloudcad.file.save` in one request.
   `create` accepts **anything** and returns `status: 0`, even `{}` or `{"canvases": "nope"}`, so a
   `status: 0` proves nothing. Run the linter (Bundled tools) and look at a render (Verifying).
5. Give the user the `data` URL returned by `save`.

In Node, `scripts/cad_helpers.js` does steps 2–4: `emptyCanvas`, `text`, `hatch`,
`rectCloud`/`revisionCloud`, `attributeStyle(plotScale)`,
`wrapInTitleBlock({ canvas, plotScale })` and `lint(cad_data)`.

## `cad_data` structure

```json
{
  "settings": { "canvasLengthUnits": "mm" },
  "attributeStyles": [ { "id": "as-default", "name": "Default", "settings": { } } ],
  "blockReferences": [ ],
  "pdfExport": { "pdfPages": [ ] },
  "s3d": { },
  "canvases": [ { "name": "Plan", "lines": [ ], "dimensions": [ ], "texts": [ ] } ]
}
```

| Key | Required | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `canvases` | **yes** | Array of drawing sheets. Each canvas holds the element arrays: `points`, `lines`, `polylines`, `dimensions`, `angleDimensions`, `radiusDimensions`, `leaderTexts`, `multiLeaderTexts`, `texts`, `tables`, `axes`, `constructionLines`, `revisionClouds`, `hatches`, `images`, `block_instances`, `layers`. |
| `attributeStyles` | effectively yes | Named sizing styles for annotations; elements point to one with `attributeStyleId`. |
| `settings` | no | Display/snap/colour settings, plus `canvasLengthUnits`. Every field is optional. |
| `blockReferences` | no | Block **definitions**: top-level and camelCase. Canvases only place them, via `block_instances`. |
| `pdfExport` | no | Printed page frames. |
| `s3d` | no | Metadata for turning the CAD drawing into an S3D model. See [`references/s3d-mapping.md`](references/s3d-mapping.md). |

Verified minimum: `{"canvases":[{"lines":[...]}]}` renders. Missing element arrays,
`version`/`schema`/`drawing_type`/`is_base` are all optional. Real platform exports omit
`drawing_type` and `is_base`. Including every array as `[]` is still the safe default
(`emptyCanvas()` does this), because the editor expects them.

**Field-by-field schema for every element type** (`settings` keys, style keys, lines, polylines,
the three dimension types, leaders, text, tables, axes, construction lines, revision clouds,
hatches, images, layers, blocks): read
[`references/elements.md`](references/elements.md) before writing an element type you haven't
written in this session.

## Minimal working example

Verified live: this renders a 6 m × 4 m rectangle with a dimension and a label, then saves it.

          { "p1": { "x": 0, "y": -4000 },    "p2": { "x": 0, "y": 0 } }
        ],
        "dimensions": [ { "p1": { "x": 0, "y": 0 }, "p2": { "x": 6000, "y": 0 },

      } ]
    } } },
    { "function": "cloudcad.file.save", "arguments": { "name": "ground-floor", "path": "projects/cad/" } }
  ]
}
```

## Functions

| Function | Arguments | Returns (verified) |
|---|---|---|
| `cloudcad.model.create` | `cad_data` (object) | `{status: 0, msg: "CloudCAD session successfully created.", data: ""}`, plus a new `session_id`. The docs' msg text is out of date. |
| `cloudcad.file.save` | `name`, `path` (strings); `public_share`, `return_uid_url` (booleans) | `data` is always `https://platform.skyciv.com/cad?u=<uid>`. **No `public_link` is returned, whatever `public_share` / `return_uid_url` are set to.** |
| `cloudcad.file.open` | `name` + `path`, or `uid` | `{status: 0, msg: "", data: ""}`, **even for a file that doesn't exist**, and nothing appears in the session. Don't build on it (see Gotchas). |

There is no `cloudcad.model.get`/`set`/export function: the API can't read a drawing's JSON back
or export a PDF/DXF. Calling one returns `"The function '...' could not be found"`.

## Coordinates

- 2D only. **`y` is negative going up the screen/sheet.** To draw something upward, subtract from y.
  Mapping an S3D model (y up) needs `y_cad = -y_model`.
- No origin boundary; negative coordinates are fine.
- Rotation units differ by element, and every one of these was verified by render:

| Field | Unit | Positive direction on screen |
|---|---|---|
| `texts[].rotation`, `images[].rotation` | degrees | clockwise |
| `block_instances[].rotation` | **radians** (`90` renders at 90 rad ≈ 116.6°) | clockwise |
| `constructionLines[].angle` | degrees | counter-clockwise (30 rises to the right) |

## Sizing: one rule

Pick the plot scale `S` (100 for 1:100). Every **length-valued** style setting is
`printed mm × S`:

| Style setting | Printed size | At 1:100 | At 1:50 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dimensionTextSize`, `angle/radiusDimensionTextSize`, `leaderTextSize` | 3.78 mm | 378 | 189 |
| `linearArrowLength` / `Width` (and angle/radius/leader) | 2.16 mm | 216 | 108 |
| `axisCircleDiameter` / `axisTextSize` | 10.8 / 3.24 mm | 1080 / 324 | 540 / 162 |
| `axisDashLength` / `axisDashGap` | 2.16 / 1.08 mm | 216 / 108 | 108 / 54 |
| `tableFontSize` | 4 mm | 400 | 200 |

`attributeStyle(S)` in the helper builds this. Don't scale `textSizeInput`, which is not a length.
When a generator switches plot scale, it rescales the **style** (and any page furniture) by the
same factor and leaves the geometry at true size.

Plain `texts` do **not** use the style for size. `size` is a unitless factor that renders at
roughly **16 mm of character width per unit** (monospace), verified across zoom levels: a
17-character string at `size: 14` was about 3.9 m wide. So `size: 14` suits a building-scale plan
at 1:100. For a 1:10 detail, divide it by about 10.

## Verifying a drawing (you can't open the viewer)

Undocumented, but useful: when any call in a request **fails**, the response's top-level
`response.screenshot` holds an 800×600 base64 PNG of the headless CloudCAD editor, showing the
model built so far. To see your drawing, append a deliberately unknown call after `create`, such as
`{"function": "cloudcad.model.get", "arguments": {}}`, then decode `response.screenshot`. It costs
one credit and the view is not always zoomed to your content. This is a **debugging aid** for
checking a new generator's output, not something to leave in production code.

## Gotchas

All of these were verified against the live API on 2026-09-22.

- **`create` never validates.** Empty, garbage or broken `cad_data` returns `status: 0`, and
  `validate_input` has no effect on it. Lint the payload and check a render.
- **Never scale geometry to fit a page.** Dimensions measure the real distance between their
  points, so scaling corrupts every label: a 24 ft span once read `40000mm`. Translate only. If
  the drawing doesn't fit, change the plot scale or sheet.
- **Never pre-convert coordinates for `canvasLengthUnits`.** Dividing coordinates by 304.8 *and*
  setting `"ft"` converts twice (24 ft became `0.08 ft`).
- **Hatch segments need `start`/`end`.** Segments with only `p1`/`p2` make `create` hang until
  it times out (about 43 s, reproduced twice). Real exports carry both field pairs.
- **Revision clouds need a precomputed `arcs` array.** With `arcs: []`, or no `arcs`, the cloud is
  accepted but draws **nothing**. The platform doesn't generate the scallops. Build them with
  `rectCloud()` / `revisionCloud()`.
- **Linear dimensions:** omit `projectionType` to get an **aligned, true-length** dimension (a
  3-4-5 diagonal reads `5000.0 mm`). `"horizontal"` / `"vertical"` give that projection (the same
  diagonal reads 3000 / 4000). Any other value, including `"aligned"`, is treated as a projection
  rather than aligned.
- **Text needs a light `color`.** The canvas is dark, and a text with no `color` renders near-black
  and invisible. Use `#ffffff` / `#e2e8f0` / `#94a3b8`. PDF output colours are unverified.
- **`textPosition` on every text.** Rendering works without it, but the editor is reported to
  crash when the user selects such a text. `alignment` anchors the text at `position` as you'd
  expect (`center` centres it on x, `right` ends it at x), so don't also pre-shift `position`.
- **Missing or unknown `attributeStyleId` fails silently.** The element falls back to the built-in
  style (grey labels, default sizes).
- **Images don't render inside a block definition.** Tables, axes, text, linear and radius
  dimensions do. Put
  logos on the canvas `images` array. An image's `x`/`y` is its top-left corner and it extends
  toward **+y** (down the screen).
- **`cloudcad.file.open` gives no signal.** It returns `status: 0` for files that don't exist and
  loads nothing observable, so "open → edit → save" doesn't work. To change a drawing, regenerate
  the full `cad_data`, then `create` + `save` it with the same `name`/`path`.
- **Don't paste the asset JSON into a prompt.** `assets/title-block-a2.json` is about 50 KB and the
  two example exports are about 125 KB each. Load them in code (`fs.readFileSync`) and copy the
  pieces.
